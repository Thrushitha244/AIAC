# Comparison of documentation styles:
# (a) Docstring:
# Advantages:
# - Provides a clear and structured way to document the function.
# - Can be easily accessed using the help() function in Python.
# Disadvantages:
# - May be overlooked by developers who are not familiar with the format.
# Suitable use cases:
# - Ideal for documenting functions, classes, and modules in Python.
# (b) Inline comments:
# Advantages:
# - Provides immediate context and explanations for specific lines of code.
# Disadvantages:
# - Can clutter the code if overused, making it harder to read.
# Suitable use cases:
# - Best for explaining complex logic or specific implementation details within the code.
# (c) Google-style documentation:
# Advantages:
# - Provides a clear and consistent format for documenting code, making it easier to read and understand
# Disadvantages:
# - May require more effort to maintain and update compared to inline comments.
# Suitable use cases:
# - Ideal for larger projects or libraries where consistent documentation is crucial for maintainability.
# Recommendation:
# For a mathematical utilities library, the Google-style documentation is most effective. This is because it provides a consistent and readable format that is widely recognized and supported by tools like Sphinx, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the library.
